# VNTemplate
A Visual Novel Template for Godot Engine

Core dialog system can be found in /scenes/fundamental/details/generalDialog.gd

For basic dialog for RPG games, then Dialogic might be a better addon than this, because
this is solely focused on the making of Visual/Graphic Novel. Renpy is also a good 
alternative if your game doesn't include advanced features or complicated minigames.
